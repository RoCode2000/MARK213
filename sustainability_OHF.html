                                    Month?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><b>The Oral Health Foundation</b> is an independent charity (not
                                    for profit), based in the United Kingdoms, dedicated to improving oral health and
                                    wellbeing around the world. For more than 45 years they have continued to provide
                                    expert, independent and impartial advice on all aspects of oral health directly to
                                    those who need it most.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Formed in 1971, the concept of preventive dentistry and the
                                    benefits which could ensue from it were then very new and being practiced by only a
                                    small proportion of the dental profession. The founding fathers of the Oral Health
                                    Foundation wished to see the preventive message that 'Teeth are for Life' spread as
                                    widely as possible, with the aim of improving the overall oral health of everyone
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><b>National Smile Month </b> is a charity campaign that focuses on
                                    spreading awareness about the benefits of good oral health and promoting the value
                                    of a healthy smile. Every year, between 13 May and 13 June, the Oral Health
                                    Foundation promotes the understanding of important healh issues and provides oral
                                    health support to some of the most vulnerable members of society.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">During National Smile Month, the Oral Health Foundation aims to
                                    promote these 4 key messsages for better oral health:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Brush teeth for two minutes, last thing at night and one other time during the
                                        day, with a fluoride toothpaste.</li>
                                    <li>Clean between your teeth with interdental brushes or floss, and use mouthwash
                                        every day.</li>
                                    <li>Cut down how much and how often you have sugary foods and drinks.</li>
                                    <li>Visit a dentist regularly.</li>
                                </ul>

                                </h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Oral B has consistently donated to the Oral Health Foundation for
                                    more than a decade and have been involved with the National Smile Month initiative
                                    since they became the initiative’s very first Platinum sponsor.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Oral B’s continued dedication to the National Smile Month
                                    initiative allowed the charity to reach even more people with positive messages
                                    regarding oral health and hygiene as well as provide support to more groups where
                                    oral disease is far too common.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Oral B and the Oral Health Foundation’s shared vision and values,
                                    their commitment to prevention as well as sheer determination in raising awareness
                                    of the correlations between oral health and general health have led to this
                                    longstanding partnership, the overall improvement of the United Kingdom’s national
                                    health as well as the oral health of many individuals across the world.</p>
