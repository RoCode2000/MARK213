                                            <p>When <strong>segmented by gender</strong>, the overall comparison shows a slight difference at each age group in <strong>favour of the female population</strong> whereby the female population aged 25 years and older were the <strong>majority</strong> when compared to the male population aged 25 years and older. Conversely, the male population aged 24 and younger was also <strong>slightly greater</strong> at each age group than the female population aged 24 and younger.</p>

                                            <p>The oral healthcare market <strong>targets young adults and the middle aged</strong>. Those <strong>aged 18-34</strong> were <strong>1.64</strong> times more likely to engage in oral healthcare compared to the elderly aged 60 years or older. <strong>Married individuals</strong> and those with <strong>tertiary education</strong> have also been reported to have <strong>higher odds</strong> of oral healthcare utilisation compared to those with no formal education. Gender and income levels were also identified as contributing demographic variables whereby <strong>females and those with higher income</strong> were more likely to utilise oral healthcare.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Balanced Optimists</strong> are also targeted since they are persuaded by products that <strong>improve their personal health</strong> and wellbeing. They aim for a stable lifestyle and place importance on enjoying the present and planning for the future. It is also noted that <strong>61%</strong> of the them look for ways to simplify their lives and this would indicate their preference for purchasing the interdental brush as a more <strong>convenient replacement</strong> to the traditional floss.</p>

                                            <p>In <strong>conclusion</strong>, the most ideal target customer is a <strong>health conscious married young adult female with tertiary education and high income</strong>. It has also been reported that health conscious young adults <strong>value efficiency and convenience</strong> when purchasing products and this is due to the new normal of having stressful and fast paced lives. In terms of <strong>consumer behavior</strong>, the initial stage where consumers start to search for their ideal interdental brush exemplifies the <strong>Variety Seeking Behavior</strong> and once they have settled on the interdental brush that best suits their needs, the consumer behavior transitions to the <strong>Habitual Buying Behavior</strong> where they have little thought of making repeat purchases.</p>

                                                <p>Aside from this, Pearlie White also capitalises on the fact that all of its products are <strong>manufactured in Singapore</strong> which is synonymous with quality due to the common perception that Singapore has very tight health and safety regulations as well as being known for having <strong>high standards</strong>.</p>
                                                <p>Producing locally however has led to an <strong>increase</strong> to their products’ selling prices at an estimated <strong>25%</strong> above their competitors’ selling price. This was a contributing factor in their plan to <strong>justify</strong> their higher prices by making it known to consumers of their <strong>high quality</strong> products and continuous improvements.</p>

                                                <p>Pearlie White also uses short term techniques like <strong>sales & promotions</strong> to encourage <strong>trial and rebuy</strong>.

                                            <p>TePe is applying the <strong>greenwashing strategy</strong> as they promote their in-house manufacturing process that complements their commitment to <strong>sustainability</strong>. Uses of fossil-based materials in products and packaging are being increasingly <strong>replaced</strong> by renewable materials such as plant based materials.</p>
                                            <p>TePe also makes use of <strong>solar energy</strong> during the summer to manufacture its products 24 hours a day. The company’s factory is covered with <strong>solar panels</strong> which make it possible for TePe to use <strong>100% renewable energy</strong> supplemented by the power generated from the solar panels. Even the roof of their factory is home to 100,000 bees who help to pollinate their <strong>green roof concept</strong> and produce honey to be given as gifts to employees and visitors.</p>

                                            <p>TePe also tries to upkeep their public image by using <strong>public relation tactics</strong>. The most recent example is their recent <strong>breast cancer campaign</strong> that donates a portion of their sales from Tepe Angle Interdental Brush to the <strong>Breast Cancer Foundation</strong>. This campaign was done in Singapore on Singapore’s platforms like Lazada and Shopee.</p>
